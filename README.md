Glad to have you here!

Currently working at [Healx](https://healx.io). Also, I'm [Python Vigo](https://www.python-vigo.es)
organiser, [A Industriosa](https://aindustriosa.org) and [VigoTech Alliance](https://vigotech.org)
member.

## Interests

I work as FullStack (whatever it means). I enjoy creating solutions for real problems, dealing
with challenging legacy, working inside a team and learning **every** single day.

I bealive that one of the most valuable thing for achieving goals is communication.

| “Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.”

Something important to share: I **love** the Python community.

## Goals for 2020

Keep improving my coding skills and contributing to the local tech community. So I'll organise a few
more events in [Python Vigo](https://www.python-vigo.es) and [A Industriosa](https://aindustriosa.org)
before the end of the year!. Focus and no side projects.

## Current tech stack

**Languages:** Python | Javascript | Typescript

**Other technologies & tools:** PostgreSQL | Docker | Ansible | AWS | Google Cloud
